# Forensic challenges

## sysadmin1

Task:
```  
Our sysadmin has disappeared and we can no longer access our sysadmin web portal.

We managed to get an image of his harddrive, but we don't know which bitlocker password corresponds to his drive. Can you help us unlock it?
```

Provided is a file `sysadmin.zip` containing a .vhd bitlocker image file and a list of passwords.\
With no experience with bitlocker, googling around some suggest some kali tools to get some more information.

Firstly using the kali tool `bitlocker2john` to extract some hashes from the .vhd file\
Then using `john` to crack the hashes, with the passwords provided in the file bitlocker-passwords.txt to get the correct one.

My kali and linux instances were docker, in which it's non-trivial for third-time-user of docker to mount devices,\
so teammate to the rescue with how to mount it:


`losetup -o 65536 /dev/loop10 sysadmin.vhd` \
`dislocker -v -V /dev/loop10 -payRTBNm6kWG28FZVDgzuwxfj -- /media/mount/`\
`mount -t ntfs-3g -o loop /media/mount/dislocker-file /media/bitlockermount`\
